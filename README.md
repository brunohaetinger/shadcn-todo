# 📝 To-Do List with ShadCN UI

A simple **To-Do List** app built with **React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN UI**.  
This project is a learning exercise to explore how to use **ShadCN UI components** and practice React state management.

🛠 How It Works

- Uses useState for managing tasks

- Tasks are stored as objects:

```ts
type Todo = {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
};
```


- UI components are imported from @/components/ui (generated by ShadCN)
- Example components used:
    - Input → text entry
    - Button → add & delete
    - Checkbox → mark tasks complete
    - Card → display each task

📂 Project Structure

```graphql
src/
├── components/        # ShadCN UI components live here
├── App.tsx            # Main To-Do List logic
├── main.tsx           # App entry point
└── index.css          # Tailwind base styles

```

🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand how to set up ShadCN UI
- Learn how to use prebuilt, accessible UI components
- Practice React state management with a real example
- Get comfortable with Tailwind styling

🧪 Possible Extensions

✅ Persist todos in localStorage
✅ Add filters (All / Active / Completed)
✅ Add animations with Framer Motion
✅ Add dark mode toggle (ShadCN supports it)
