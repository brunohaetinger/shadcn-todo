🛠 How It Works

- Uses useState for managing tasks

- Tasks are stored as objects:

```ts
type Todo = {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
};
```


- UI components are imported from @/components/ui (generated by ShadCN)
- Example components used:
    - Input → text entry
    - Button → add & delete
    - Checkbox → mark tasks complete
    - Card → display each task
